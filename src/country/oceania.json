            "description": "Truth be told, American Samoa is not a known as a popular tourist destination. Most people that visit are usually only passing through as a day stop on a cruise. However, there is so much more to this southern Pacific island than just grabbing a few trinkets and souvenirs. The territory is made up of five islands: Tutuila, Aunu'u, Ta'u, Ofu, and Olosega. Each of them are worth visiting. Most people that visit frequent the island of Tutuila where the international airport is located. But, the National Park of American Samoa is a truly unique and amazing place that covers land on Tutuila, Ofu, and Ta'u. Aside from its amazing  landscape and array of wildlife, it is unique because the land isn't federally owned. Rather, it is leased from the families who own it. It not only promotes a healthy relationship with the locals and the federal government, it preserves the incredible Samoan heritage that has existed here for hundreds of years. So, don't come looking for five star resorts and bustling cities. Rather, be ready for a calm, low-key visit that only a quaint island territory can offer."

In a place so large, it can be incredibly difficult to know what to see or do. But, it's not for a lack of options. Australia is rich with history, being one of the oldest Aboriginal cultures in the world. The vast majority of the country's population is spread amongst the thousands of miles of coastline. However, should one venture deeper towards the interior of the island, they'll be able to see more of a dichotomy of cultures; a unique mix of modern and Aboriginal traditions. If you visit Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory, you can see some amazing rock art that dates back more than 20,000 years. It is also a great place to see a wide variety of wildlife and landscapes like floodplanes. For something that's a little more “touristy”, look no further than the bigger cities like Melbourne or Sydney. Melbourne has some amazing sites such as the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria, the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the National Gallery of Victoria, and the Eureka Skydeck. For those who decide to hang out in Sydney instead, you obviously can check out the world famous Sydney Opera House, check out one of the near 1,000 stalls along Paddy's Market, or simply enjoy a day at Bondi Beach."

They're always excited to show people their cultures and customs. From Kava ceremonies and fire-walking to the Hindu Snake Temple and Spice Market, visitors will feel like locals in no time whatsoever. On top of these things, there is no shortage of breathtaking scenery, both on land and sea, to enjoy. Bouma National Heritage Park is one of the most spectacular nature reserves in any of the southern Pacific nations.

There's no getting around what makes this island so popular to tourists. Its beauty is unmistakable and nearly unmatched by any other island in the world. The beautiful blue waters wash up to shores that are mostly surrounded by forests. In many places, these forests suddenly rise up, turning into mountains with near vertical cliffs. Although it is an official territory of France, the country has some of its own self-governing powers, including its own president. France mostly controls things like currency, foreign policy, and a few other things. Visitors will be able to pick up on the French influences as well as see places where the French and English battled over the territory for years. Whether you're looking for something similar to a resort, or trying to just enjoy a scenic get away, French Polynesia will definitely not disappoint."

Nearly every week, there will be some sort of party or fiesta that revolves around great food and some form of entertainment. Best of all, they're all open invitation. So, be ready for some food, fun, and great fellowship with the island's residents. When you're not eating and partying like crazy, you'll want to get out and experience everything else that Guam has to offer. The beaches are among the best in the world, allowing for spectacular, unobstructed views of the sunrise and sunsets.. But, for divers as well, there are plenty of reefs and shipwrecks to explore as well. Whether you're there for the fun, the atmosphere, or even to experience some of the amazing history, Guam is an absolutely incredible place to spend what will end up being an unforgettable vacation."

Don't let this hold you back though. There is enough here to keep any tourist entertained and occupied for months. The population of Kiribati is just over 100,000. However, it has its own unique culture and language. It is believed that these have survived for so long due to the nation's isolation. But, even though it's quite difficult to get to, there is still plenty to do. To really take in the culture, many tourists take village tours, taking in the local customs. History buffs will be interested in South Tarawa where one of the worst battles were fought during World War II. Finally, outdoorsmen will be able to takeadvantage of some incredible diving and snorkeling sites, or stay on  land and do some bird watching."

How many people can say they've been to a place where a nuclear bomb had exploded? Now, we we'll go ahead and answer your next question. Yes, it's safe to travel there now. As a matter of fact, it's quite easy. The Marshall Islands is under the Compact of Free Association, which means that United States citizens do not need a visa when they go to visit. Once you're there though, you'll be among an exclusive group of people as the Marshall Islands are one of the least visited countries inn the world, averaging around 5,000 people per year. Here's what this means for a tourist though. You're going to have a very quiet and peaceful time, not having to jostle for positions with other visitors. Those who visit between May and October will be able to take advantage of some of the best fishing in the world with over 1,000 different species calling the waters around the island home. It doesn't matter if you're going deep-sea or simply fishing from the shore. It will be unlike any other fishing you've ever done. If you're feeling more adventurous, book a charter out to the ship graveyard from the various ships that were sunk during the various nuclear tests. It's a breathtaking underwater seascape that is unmatched by any other dive site in the world."

It doesn't take long to see that Micronesia is a melting pot of inhabitants from various different cultures. The importance of costumes in many of the various cultures is very high as the people take great pride in showcasing their unique traits. They are very warm, kind-hearted, and welcoming to tourists. So, don't be surprised if you get drawn into the warmth of the people. Who knows. You may even make some friends while you're there. If you are strong enough to break away from the allure of the people and venture out to see the land, there are a few places you need to see.  Diving and history enthusiasts will enjoy Eten Island, a place used by the Japanese during World War II. Now, you can see tanks and other structures submerged in the water. If you want to enjoy city life and shopping, go to the capital city of Palikir. Packed full of shopping, entertainment, and plenty of places to be pampered. Lastly, for those that want to escape everything, go to Pakin Atoll where the views are spectacular and only 100 people live. It is where seclusion suddenly becomes soothing."

Many of these places can be seen in various movies including Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. To put it simply, it is probably the place that Bob Ross dreamed about every night before he painted. Adding even more flare to the already amazing country, New Zealand is home to the Maori culture, one of the most unique cultures found anywhere in the world. Once known as being some of the fiercest warriors in the world, they now carry on their heritage by continuing to perform their ceremonial “hakas”. These were dances and chants that their warriors would perform in front of their enemies before going into battle. Now though, these dances performed as one of the highest honors anyone could get. After you've taken a tour of the countryside and enjoyed the traditions of the locals, visitors have an endless list of things to do. Wine aficionados can check out some of the world famous vineyards. Those who enjoy a touch of the eclectic will love some of the seasonal festivals such as the Queenstown Winter Festival and the annual Easter Jazz Festival.

Let's start with the island's beauty. When you think of Pacific islands, you usually picture sandy beaches and coconut palm trees. That's not the case on Niue. Here, instead of beaches, you have limestone cliffs that drop into chasms of turquoise waters. Should you explore these chasms by boat, there's a good chance you'll run across a number of caves and coral formations. It's a unique beauty that can't be found anywhere else in the area. So, the island is beautiful. But, what about that beautiful humanity we were talking about? Well, Niue is considered to be one of the safest places on Earth. Here, residents watch out for each other as if they were family. Cars are regularly left unlocked. There's even a place  called Washaway Bar and Cafe which runs on an honor system. Customers simply write down their orders in a book, put their money in the register themselves, and grab what they paid for.

It is full of incredible views, incredible people, and incredible adventures. For starters, foodies will especially appreciate Norfolk Island. All fruit and vegetables are grown on the island. When they're in season, the fruits and veggies are usually harvested and put on your plate in the very same day. It's the same for things such as fish and beef, which are also locally raised. So, whether you appreciate a sweet treat or a savory meal, you can definitely find it here.The landscape here is actually very different than most of the other tropical islands.

No one alive on Earth can speak truly for what lies in some of the deepest parts of Papua New Guinea's forests. Traveling outside of any larger cities, you'll come face to face with a largely tribal population. Ornate costumes are coupled with face paintings. Small, skinny canoes go hand in hand with hand-woven fish traps that are used to catch the evening's meals. Most of these tribes are friendly and curious of outsiders. However, should you decide to go exploring, you may end up encountering an uncontacted tribe; people who have never seen a white person, or a cell phone, or even a mirror. This is a very unlikely chance, but it illustrates how wild the country really is.

            "description": "One of the true hidden gems of the Southern Pacific are the Solomon Islands. It's a place that most people skip over in lieu of some of the more popular places like Fiji and Bora Bora. However, skipping any one of these 900+ islands would be a big mistake. It's only a three hour flight from Australia to get to the Solomon Island.Ideally, that would make it a great destination, right? Well, the islands haven't been catering to more commercial tourists. Because of this, the Solomons haven't been overrun with many tourists. Much of the nature and landscape is completely untouched. Many of the villages are set up the way they have been for hundreds of years. The Solomon Islands is also a great destination for the adventurous diver. Now, we aren't just talking about the typical fish-spotting dives.We are talking about making discoveries. In a chain of over 900 islands, new things are being found all the time. Within the last couple of years, at least three World War 2 shipwrecks have been found, and there are probably more. When you're diving in the Solomon Islands, there's always something new and incredible to discover."

            "description": "Do you want to travel to a nice, tropical location in the South Pacific, yet you can't make up your mind what you want to do on your trip? Well then, Tonga is the place for you. It's a Pacific island country that has a wide range of things pretty much year round. One of the most unique things about Tonga is the fact that you can travel to a number of its various islands and feel like you're in a different country, even though you aren't. It's because so many geographical features are vastly different from the other. The Island of 'Eau is a single island with rocky formations and a national park forest. Vava'u is an endless maze of very small islands that seem like labyrinths. Ha'apai is a collection of small islands that are typical coconut palm trees. All of them are Tonga.What truly makes a great vacation though is an ability to have a once in a lifetime experience. Tonga offers that to people. Take snorkeling and swimming as an example. Usually, these activities don't come with much promise of a life-changing event. However, in Tonga, you can swim and dive with humpback whales, manta rays, or even seals. These wild animals have never been in danger around these islands and know to trust people."
